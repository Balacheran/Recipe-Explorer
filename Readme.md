Sure thing! Let's create comprehensive README files for both the backend and frontend of your application. These will provide a clear guide on setting up, running, and understanding the project.

### Backend README

```markdown
# Food Recipe Backend

- Mongoose
- Multer (for handling file uploads)
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens for authentication)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB (either local or a cloud database like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-recipe-backend.git
   cd food-recipe-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

### API Endpoints
